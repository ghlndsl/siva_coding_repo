A Visual Git Reference
This page gives brief, visual reference for the most common commands in git. Once you know a bit about how git works, this site may solidify your understanding.

Git Is Simpler Than You Think
This article provides an overview of the interna of a git repository.

Git: Twelve Curated Tips And Workflows From The Trenches
My Evernote tech-tips folder and my Notational Velocity stash have been collecting a huge list of git tips, many of which I have to look up again and again. Until I finally give up and create aliases for them (by the way you can find some of my more advanced git aliases explained in my previous post).
I expect many git practitioners will find them useful as much as I do. Here we go, let’s start from tiny and simple things first.

Git from the bottom up (PDF)
In my pursuit to understand Git, it’s been helpful for me to understand it from the bottom up — rather than look at it only in terms of its high-level commands. And since Git is so beautifully simple when viewed this way, I thought others might be interested to read what I’ve found, and perhaps avoid the pain I went through ﬁnding it.



Distributed Git - Maintaining a Project
In addition to knowing how to effectively contribute to a project, you’ll likely need to know how to maintain one. This can consist of accepting and applying patches generated via format-patch and e-mailed to you, or integrating changes in remote branches for repositories you’ve added as remotes to your project. Whether you maintain a canonical repository or want to help by verifying or approving patches, you need to know how to accept work in a way that is clearest for other contributors and sustainable by you over the long run.

A successful Git branching model
In this post I present the development model that I’ve introduced for all of my projects (both at work and private) about a year ago, and which has turned out to be very successful. I’ve been meaning to write about it for a while now, but I’ve never really found the time to do so thoroughly, until now. I won’t talk about any of the projects’ details, merely about the branching strategy and release management.

A Git Workflow for Agile Teams
An efficient workflow for developers in Agile teams that handles features and bugs while keeping a clean and sane history.
At Hashrocket we use git both internally and in our Agile mentoring and training. Git gives us the flexibility to design a version control workflow that meets the needs of either a fully Agile team or a team that is transitioning towards an Agile process.
There are many usable git workflows. Indeed, git is really “a tool for designing VCS workflows” rather than a Version Control System itself. Or, as Linus would say, git is just a stupid content tracker.
This is by no means a normative document or my attempt to define The One True Workflow. I have found this workflow to be productive and relatively painless, especially for teams that are still learning and transitioning towards a more Agile process. I invite you to comment below and describe the git workflow that works best for you.

A rebase-based workflow
When I first started working with Git in mid 2008 I was blissfully oblivious to the concept of a "rebase" and why somebody might ever use it. While at Slide we were crazy for merging (see diagram to the right), everything pretty much revolved around merges between branches. To add insult to injury, development revolved around a single central repository which everyone had the ability to push to. Merges compounded upon merges led to a frustratingly complex merge history.

FeatureBranch by M. Fowler
With the rise of Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) such as git and Mercurial, I've seen more conversations about strategies for branching and merging and how they fit in with Continuous Integration (CI). There's a bit of confusion here, particularly on the practice of feature branching and how it fits in with CI.

git - let's make errors ( and learn how to revert them )
I am able to use it more or less; but I always feel a little scared and confused about what's happening. I feel that I want more informations. I have followed some tutorial and read distractedly some book but, with too much information I always end up with just the feeling that I could do what I want to do. But I do not know how to do it.
