# How To Use FeedBack

## Without feedback, you're limited to only your perspective
the tricky part is that feedback can be misleading.『Henry Ford famously remarked that if he had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses, not the automobile.』
What people say they want and what they actually respond to can be quite different things.

## M1: care whwat they do, not what they say
The first heuristic for getting more reliable feedback is to study people’s actions, not their advice. because of disconnection
Some examples:
Selling a product? Watch someone using the product, don’t just ask them what features they want.
Learning a language? Notice how people speak—not just the explanation they give. For example, most English speakers pronounce ‘water’ with a ‘d’ sound not a ‘t’ sound (but most would deny that).
Want more dates? Look at how women or men respond to your actions, not the reasoning they give. Both men and women are notorious for having a disconnect between what they claim to want and how they respond.
Improve your career? Look at what career moves people actually made, not just the retrospective lessons they shared after. (Hint: Steve Jobs didn’t actually follow the advice he gave in his famous Stanford commencement address.)
Because advice, as opposed to observable actions, is the easiest feedback to receive, many people stop there and fail to consider that it may be wrong.

## M2: decide what feedback you cant get

Some examples:
Improving your resume? Friends and family will tell you to change the font or word order. They won’t tell you what experiences you need to stand out.
Writing a book? People will point out the typo on page 124, but won’t tell you the writing is dull.
Building a product? Your customers will tell you a small feature is broken, but they can’t tell you that the product is unremarkable.

with creative endeavors, nobody has your vision of a product but you. all people can see is what you've placed before them, not what it has the potential of becoming.

# M3: learn which haters to ignore(adn which to listen to)
Popular wisdom says to ignore the haters. Focus your product on people who love you instead of trying to please the people who don’t.
Yes, finding a niche and picking a particular audience is important.
Sometimes a critic is really someone who has the potential to love what you do, but is holding you to a higher standard than you’re currently able to meet.
Some examples:
Want to write better? Ignore the person who writes a poorly worded hate letter. Listen to the person who thoughtfully criticizes your research or arguments.
Grow your company? Ignore the complaints from the free-trial freeloader. Listen to the complaints from the person who spends money on products like yours, but opted for a competitor.
Improve your communication skills? Ignore the negative comments from people on the sidelines. Listen to the critiques from the people you’re trying to reach.

#M4: get feedback from the absence of feedback
silence can also be feedback
Sometimes feedback isn’t available. Especially in the beginning phases of a business or project, you might not have access to the people whose opinion matters to you.
In my writing, I know an article failed not because it generated a lot of negative comments, but because it generated few comments at all.

## Should you use feedback at all?
Feedback is important, but it isn’t a panacea. In creative fields, having tons of feedback can’t make up from a lack of vision.Sometimes I’ve found it beneficial to ignore feedback entirely. This applies when the feedback is distracting,
