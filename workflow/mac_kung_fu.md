“比较法”这可以把用户的注意力从“主动挑刺” 转移到“被动比较”上去，本质上是把绝对标准变成了相对标准。绝对标准是高不可及的（用户自己都不知道怎样才是最好），但相对标准只是两个版本里较好的那个。
The same thing happens when a customer say “I think this one is better than that one”. Well, this trick switches user’s attention from unknown “Absolute Standard” to specific and clear “Relative Standard”, which make it easier to be satisfied.
